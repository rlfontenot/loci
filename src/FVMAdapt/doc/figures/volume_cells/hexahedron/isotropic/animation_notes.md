# Hexahedron Animation Notes

This directory keeps the editable TikZ source and generated web assets for the
hexahedron refinement figures used in the FVMAdapt overview notes.

## Source Model

`hexahedron_cell.tex` draws the hexahedron cell, and
`hexahedron_midpoint_based_isotropic.tex` draws the same cell with the
face-centroid, edge-midpoint, and volume-centroid split lines.

`hexahedron_midpoint_based_isotropic_exploded.tex` defines the wireframe exploded
hexahedron vertex-cell geometry for the combined motion/yaw animation. The view
is controlled by `\fvmadaptYawAngle`, which changes the projected `x` and `y`
basis vectors while leaving `z` vertical.
The explosion amount is controlled by `\fvmadaptExplodeAmount`, where `0`
places the duplicated child cells in their assembled positions and `1` moves
them to the fully exploded positions.
Explosion distance can be scaled with `\fvmadaptExplodeScale`; the combined
renderer uses `1.69`.

The child cells are drawn in their natural, un-exploded coordinates and moved
with TikZ `scope` shifts. The current explosion heuristic keeps the child at
the original `xi`/`eta`/`zeta` minimum corner fixed, then slides each other
child along the positive coordinate directions implied by its parent vertex.

The source also sets a fixed canvas with `\path[use as bounding box]`. This is
important for animations: the yaw sweep changes the projected image extents,
and a fixed canvas keeps every rendered frame the same size.

## Regeneration

Run this command from anywhere in the repository:

```sh
bash src/FVMAdapt/doc/figures/volume_cells/hexahedron/isotropic/render_hexahedron_midpoint_based_isotropic_exploded_motion_yaw_wire.sh
```

The combined wire motion/yaw script regenerates:

- `hexahedron_midpoint_based_isotropic_exploded_motion_yaw_wire.gif`

The GIF is a generated build artifact and is intentionally not tracked in git.

The combined wire motion/yaw GIF starts assembled at the normal yaw angle,
explodes, sweeps left and right while fully exploded, returns to the normal yaw
angle, and then collapses before restarting. It uses 41 frames with
`-delay 20`.

The script intentionally avoids ImageMagick's `-layers Optimize` pass. That
optimization rewrites frames as cropped subimages with offsets, which can look
truncated in some GIF viewers.

## Toolchain

Required local commands:

- `pdflatex` with TikZ/PGF
- `mutool`
- ImageMagick `magick` or `convert`
- `awk`
- `seq`
